# MLFringe-Contrast-CP2P2024
this is the project for CP2 spring 2024, The purpose of this project is to find fringe contrast or visibility for PGMI setup using K-space model. The one PGMI and two PGMI setups intensity has been reproduced. The codes are given, also the codes for contrast for two PGMI is given. the contrast is plotted as a function of d, (distance between two gratings).
